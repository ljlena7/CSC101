#Question 1
#Get rid of the y=0 statement. It overrules the original y=5 statement and makes it so the assignment on line 6 cannot be done because there is a runtime error for attempting to divide by 0
x = 15
y = 5
z = 3
k = x / y
print(k)

#Question 2
#To solve this error, I removed the indent on line 14. This caused a syntax error because the print statement should never be tabbed in.
x = 10
y = 20
z = 30
print(x, y, z)
