#Question 1
#Get rid of the y=0 statement. It overrules the original y=5 statement and makes it so the assignment on line 6 cannot be done because there is a runtime error for attempting to divide by 0
x = 15
y = 5
z = 3
k = x / y
print(k)

#Question 2
#To solve this error, I removed the indent on line 14. This caused a syntax error because the print statement should never be tabbed in.
x = 10
y = 20
z = 30
print(x, y, z)
     
#Question 3
#To solve this problem, I fixed the typo in line 20 that refers to the "multiplier" variable, but it leaves out the first "i". This fixes the syntax error that is caused from referencing an unknown variable.
miles = 10
multiplier = 1.609344
km = miles * multplier
print(km)
