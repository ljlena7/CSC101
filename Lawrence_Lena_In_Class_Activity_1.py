#Question 1
#Get rid of the y=0 statement. It overrules the original y=5 statement and makes it so the assignment on line 6 cannot be done because there is a runtime error for attempting to divide by 0
x = 15
y = 5
z = 3
k = x / y
print(k)

#Question 2
#To solve this error, I removed the indent on line 14. This caused a syntax error because the print statement should never be tabbed in.
x = 10
y = 20
z = 30
print(x, y, z)
     
#Question 3
#To solve this problem, I fixed the typo in line 20 that refers to the "multiplier" variable, but it leaves out the first "i". This fixes the syntax error that is caused from referencing an unknown variable.
miles = 10
multiplier = 1.609344
km = miles * multiplier
print(km)

#Question 4
#To solve this problem, I added an additional parenthesis to the end of the statement on line 29. In the original statement, there is an overarching parenthesis that is never closed, which causes the syntax error making the code unable to run.
x = 1
y = 10
z = 2
t = 15
print((x * t) / (y / z))
print('Done')

#Question 5
#To solve this problem, I fixed the spelling of the variable "fruit" in the print statements on line 35. They are all missing the "i", which causes a syntax error because they are referencing a variable "frut" that doesn't exist.
fruit = "kiwi"
print(fruit, fruit, fruit)
